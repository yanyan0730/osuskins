# yanyan's osu! skins
### here are a list of skins that I mainly use (or have used) on osu! some of these are edits/mashups of other skins, while others are just the original skin.

2024
## [kablaze/ristel edit (instafade)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ieKruSe1g0FimXSGMkf3GG5JxWtisRiF/view?usp=sharing)
this is my main skin for pretty much everything! for me personally, it works well with almost everything that i play, so i use this skin the most :D

notable features:
- cool green cursor (additional styles of green cursors in folder)
- instafade circles (i am INCAPABLE of playing without this, due to my natural focusing issue)
- no follow points  (^)
- no combo or health bar (^)
- loud(ish) hitsounds (^)
- minimalistic ui from [wintherest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1498493?n=1)
- 1st place overlay on the bottom right to keep nerves down in multi
